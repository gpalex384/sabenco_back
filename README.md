# sabenco_back
This repository contains the final project of a professional training in cross-platform development (DAM).

The traditional education system segments the areas of knowledge by subjects whose content, on many occasions, belongs to the same historical context. This segmentation makes students learn subjects separately, making it difficult to establish connections between what they learn in different subjects. 
For example, students may be studying the Generation of '98 in the first term of Language and Literature, characterised by the depression caused by the historical context of decolonisation, and on the other hand, studying this historical context in the subject of history at another time of the year or in a different year, which may make the ability to assimilate the subject in its context less effective.
This project is therefore designed to reinforce the relationship between the content of the different subjects studied at school.


The initial scope of this project is to create a proof of concept of an API that provides data related to events such as historical, cultural, social or scientific events.

1. Open terminal on project root folder.
2. Run "uvicorn sabenco:app --reload" command.

** You may have installed the following parts:**
